DHCP Lease Management Script for RouterOS v7+
Overview
This script is designed to run as a DHCP lease script on RouterOS v7 and above. It operates outside the namespace of the standard DHCP script, allowing it to bypass RouterOS limitations.
Purpose
The primary function of this script is to manage DHCP leases in the 'APs' DHCP server. It specifically handles leases with agent-circuit-id contents, matching them to static leases based on the information in their comments.
Key Features

Creates missing static leases
Updates existing static leases when agent-circuit-id matches but MAC address differs (useful for router replacements)
Sets static lease interval to 30 minutes

Operation
When executed, the script:

Scans for dynamic leases in the 'APs' DHCP server
Identifies leases with agent-circuit-id contents
Attempts to match these to static leases using comment data
Creates new static leases if no match is found
Updates existing static leases if agent-circuit-id matches but MAC address has changed

Optimal Configuration
For best performance:

Configure a short dynamic lease interval
With a 1-minute lease, the script typically takes about 1 minute to fully process

Requirements

RouterOS v7 or above
'APs' DHCP server configured

Notes
This script is particularly useful for managing network changes, such as when end-user routers are replaced, ensuring continuity of assigned IP addresses based on agent-circuit-id rather than MAC address.
Installation and Usage
[Include instructions on how to install and run the script on RouterOS]
